Data Structure - Sorting Techniques

    Sorting refers to arranging data in a particular format. Sorting algorithm specifies the way to arrange data in a particular order. Most common order are in numerical or lexicographical order.

    * Telephone Directory - The telephone Directory stores the telephone numbers of people sorted by their names, so that the names can be searched easily.
    
    * Dictionary - The dictionary stores words in an alphabetical order so that searching of any word becomes easy.



* In-place Sorting and Not-in-place Sorting

    In-Place Sorting 
        
        * In-Place Sorting means the algorithm sorts the data by rearranging elements within the original array or list itself, without needing extra memory for another data structure.

            Bubble sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort are an exmaple of in-place sorting.

    Not-In-Place(Out-of-Place) Sorting

        * Not-In-Place sorting requires extra memory to store a copy of the original data or additional structure to assist with sorting.

            Merge Sort is a classic example because it creates temporay array to hold sorted subarrays.

    Summary
        In-place sorting: Sorts within the original array, low memory use, modifies data in place.
        
        Not-in-place sorting: Uses extra memory, preserves original data, and may be easier to implement in certain cases.
